    I am creating a long-form video essay about "{topic}", focusing on the theme: "{theme}".
    Create a detailed, {sections}-part outline for the entire script.
    Each part of the outline should be a single, descriptive sentence that clearly states what that section of the video will cover.
    The outline should have a logical flow, starting with an introduction, developing the argument through the body, and ending with a conclusion.

    Example for the theme "The Dangers of the Messianic Hero in Dune":
    [
        "Introduction: Introduce the concept of the messianic archetype and pose the central question of Paul Atreides' heroism.",
        "The Bene Gesserit's Plan: Detail the Missionaria Protectiva and the centuries of religious engineering that paved Paul's path.",
        "The Weight of Terrible Purpose: Analyze Paul's prescience, exploring how seeing the future trapped him and forced his hand into jihad.",
        "The Fremen's Holy War: Describe the explosion of violence and fanaticism once Paul accepts his role as the Lisan al Gaib.",
        "The Golden Path's Shadow: Discuss the initial motivations behind the Golden Path and its horrific long-term cost to humanity.",
        "The Tyrant's Legacy in Dune Messiah: Show the horrific fallout of Paul's reign and how he ultimately failed to stop the machine he created.",
        "The Failure of the Hero: Argue that Paul's ultimate tragedy was his inability to escape the very myth he embodied.",
        "Conclusion: Summarize Herbert's warning about charismatic leaders and the dangers of placing faith in a single savior."
    ]

    Now, generate a {sections}-part outline for the topic "{topic}" with the theme "{theme}".
    Return the outline *only* as a Python list of strings.
