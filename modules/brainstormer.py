    I am creating a long-form video essay on the topic of "{topic}".
    Please brainstorm a list of 5 distinct and compelling themes or core arguments that could serve as the foundation for the entire essay.
    Each theme should be a concise, single sentence.

    Example for the topic "Star Wars":
    - The cyclical nature of war and rebellion across generations.
    - The conflict between technological advancement and spiritual faith (The Force).
    - How the Skywalker family saga serves as a modern mythological epic.
    - An analysis of the political decay from a Republic to an Empire.
    - The theme of redemption and the possibility of change even for the most evil.

    Now, generate 5 themes for the topic: "{topic}".
    Return the themes as a Python list of strings. For example: ["Theme 1.", "Theme 2.", "Theme 3.", "Theme 4.", "Theme 5."]
